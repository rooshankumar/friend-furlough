I'll inspect your app for errors causing the blank black screen. Let me check the main entry points and console for issues.

Looking at your code, I can see several potential issues:

Primary Issues Found:
Missing BrowserRouter wrapper in App.tsx - The AppContent component uses routing but BrowserRouter is not wrapping it
Double router issue - Routes are defined but not wrapped in BrowserRouter
Initialization issues - Auth store initialization might be blocking render
Let me fix the main issue in App.tsx:

src/App.tsx
+17
-25
Now let's also add error boundary logging to catch any rendering errors:

src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
+6
-10
What I fixed:

Wrapped entire app in BrowserRouter - Routes now work correctly
Added console logging - Will help debug initialization issues
Added error catching - Better error handling for initialization failures
Simplified structure - Removed duplicate/conflicting code
Next steps to debug:

Open your browser's developer console (F12)
Look for error messages in red
Check the Network tab for failed requests
If you see errors, share them with me so I can help fix them
The black screen was likely caused by the missing BrowserRouter wrapper or errors during initialization that weren't being caught/displayed.
